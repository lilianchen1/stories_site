                My high school guidance counselor once said to a group of my classmates
                and I something along the lines of: I think everyone should experience
                a bad breakup, a bad job, and a bad car. You will learn a lot about life
                from these three things and they will shape you into stronger individuals.

                To follow your head or your heart: that is the question.
                I like to think of myself as a logical person; I majored in
                a scientific field and for the longest time I thought I was
                going to walk down the academia path. Nevertheless, I guess
                deep down I'm a romantic. I was faced with a tough decision
                a little before graduation, and I chose my heart.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here, I write about the story of when I followed my heart.
