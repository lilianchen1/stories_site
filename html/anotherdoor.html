        I like motivational quotations. One of my favorite so far, that I've
        encountered on the internet, is:
        <br>
        <div class="span">
          <span class="quote">
          Sometimes the door closes on a relationship,
          not because we failed but because something
          bigger than us says this no longer fits our life.
          So, lock the door, shed a tear, turn around and look
          for the new door that is opened. It is a sign that you are no
          longer that person you were, it is time to change into who you are.
          It is going to be okay.
          </span>
        </div>
        <br>
        Granted, the door which closed on me recently wasn't that of a
        romantic relationship, it was the relationship I had with myself (who
        I think I am; who I think I will be).

        <br>

        For the longest time I thought I was going to medical school,
        become a doctor, and dedicate my life to medical sciences. I felt as if I
        was meant for that pathway, and not getting into medical school meant I was
        a failure. Even when I dreaded going to lab, hated being a patient escort and doing
        other "pre-med" activities, I
        kept saying to myself that I am doing this for medical school,
        for a future in medicine.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I didn't get into medical school, part of me felt like a failure and that part
        <span><strong>hurts</strong></span>,
        a lot. Nevertheless, part of me felt liberated. Now, I'm no longer restrained to
        that one path, and so many opportunities are now opening for me.
