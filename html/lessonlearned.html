      <h2 class="story-title">What I Have Learned From A Job That Wasn't Meant To Be</h2>
      <p class="story-paragraph">

        My high school guidance counselor once said to a group of my classmates and
        I something along the lines of: I think everyone should experience a bad breakup,
        a bad job, and a bad car. You will learn a lot about life from these three things
        and they will shape you into stronger individuals.

        My bad job convinced me to pursue what makes me happy, even if it means
        leaving the past behind and start anew. So a little background: my past is
        pre-med/biological research, and my present/future is web development/software
        engineering.

        If I'm completely honest, I never really liked bench work. I like academia,
        I like learning, and I like being creative. However, I never liked the day-to-day
        work of research, and I was never really passionate about anything I was doing.
        I stuck with it for that long because it was the only thing
        I thought I could do; it was the path I thought I had to lead.

        The breaking point happened when I was working as a research technician following
        my MIT graduation. I hated that job. But that bad job is what finally
        gave me the confidence to admit to myself that this is not what I'm meant to do. This
        bad job gave me the confidence to leave my past behind and pursue other options,
        options that I actually am excited about.

        <br>

         It took a lot of courage and confidence
         to leave. I left knowing that I had to face a world of unknown, with only
         knowing that research and academia was not what I wanted to do anymore.
         I risked upsetting
         certain people in the lab and possibly burning a bridge or two because
         when I took this job, I was expected to stay for two-full years.
         I learned to be strong, to do what was best for me even if I ended
         up leaving a bad image behind. I learned that I have to take care of
         myself and look out for my best interest because no one else will.

        What’s even more important is that this experience taught me to see
        the good in people, be grateful for whatever help others give me,
        appreciate the fun moments, and keep in mind that there is always a
        silver lining. If I didn’t do these things, I could not have survived in
        that job for a year and a half.

        I guess in the end, this job gave me the confidence to
        choose a path that I would enjoy walking on, even if it's an unexpected path
        with an unknown ending.
